#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that wants to create a system that will be designed to improve the rate of success for road tests and wants to offer online and in-person training. Liam is the owner of the company and approached us with his vision for this system. They want a web-based application that allows users to register and be able to take online classes, or in-person instruction and display all current progress on their main page along with any feedback from instructors.

#What did you do particularly well?

I have had previous experience with UML Class diagrams when programming in SQL for databases and for some C# projects, so doing the class diagrams was easy for me. I did learn a few new things about the symbols used, and used them effectively. I felt I also did fairly exceptional when writing out functional and non-functional requirements leading to the technical requirements. I'm sure there are more requirements that I could have added, but I feel that would take some experience doing full system designs to really understand every facet of a good design.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could redo one part of this project, it would be to revise the UML Diagrams. I came into this project familiar with UML Class diagrams, but when it came to activity and use case diagrams, I fell a little short of exemplary. When it came to the includes, the excludes, none of that made sense to me, even after re-reading the material multiple times. it may take some videos and practical ussage before I can finally understand the concept and proper layout.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When a client shows a need, it is our responsibility to deliver solutions to these needs in a form the clients' choose. We listen intently, and we write out all the details of what the customer wants and what they think they need. Then after the meeting, then start writing out what they actually need, because most customers won't understand all of their needs, but you'll have documented their wants and can then translate those into needs. It takes a good analyst to understand all of the aspects of a full system design. How many customers would understand the levels of encryption that would be needed to protect data, or would a customer undertand the benefits of cloud-based server hosting vs on-site hosting. What about SaaS or PaaP? That is what a good system analyst does.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software design much like a recipe. You begin by writing out all the requirements after listening to a customer describe their needs and wants, then take time to analyse those and come up with a list of needs that the customer has stated and needs that have been forgotten or from lack of understanding, and then trim the wants into feasible features that are deliverable. Then begin documenting the internal structure of the system with diagrams, charts, whatever seems to help you understand the inner workings. Then you can begin the actual coding work, the fun part.
